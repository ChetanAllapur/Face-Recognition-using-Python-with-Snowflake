# Face-Recognition-using-python-with-snowflake
Hello guys welcome to my github face recognition project. I have add the whole project of face recognition using python with snowflake.
This project mainly helps you in connecting to the snowflake database and from there it fetches name from the database and helps you in detecting the face by retrieving the the name.
This project has 2 main files:    1.config package which contains the config file, 2.the face.py file(you can find it at the end of all images).
If this project is helpful to you please give stars.
thankyou.
